[{"published":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Simply typed lambda calculus is strongly normalizing","content":"Tait showed in 1967 that beta-reduction is strongly normalizing. As a corollary beta eta-equivalence is decidable. Statman showed in 1977 that the normalisation problem is not elementary recursive. A purely semantic normalisation proof (see normalisation by evaluation) was given by Berger and Schwichtenberg in 1991."},{"published":"1936-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"General solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible","content":"In 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papers[2] showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notation of \"effectively calculable\" is captured by the functions computable by a Turing machine (or equivalently, by those expressible in the lambda calculus). This assumption is now known as the Churchâ€“Turing thesis."}]
